# Feature Specification: MCP Server for Polymarket Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `001-write-a-mcp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "write a MCP server for this polymarket wrapper package. This polymarket sdk contains more utilities for data analysis such as transforming data to markdown, also provides full type safety. A rest API with openapi is written already. I also need a MCP server to fetch data and analyze with natural language"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data analyst, I want to use a natural language interface to ask questions about Polymarket data, so that I can quickly get insights without writing code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** I ask "What are the top 5 markets by volume?", **Then** the system returns a markdown table of the top 5 markets.
2. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** I ask a question that requires fetching data from the Polymarket API, **Then** the server uses the existing REST API to fetch the data and provides an answer.
3. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** I ask a question that the model cannot answer, **Then** the system responds with a clear message indicating it cannot answer the question.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the underlying Polymarket API is unavailable?
- How does the system handle ambiguous natural language questions?
- What happens when the user asks a question that is out of scope for Polymarket data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a natural language interface for users to ask questions. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What kind of interface? A chat window in a web UI? A CLI?]
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be able to fetch data from the existing Polymarket REST API.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST be able to analyze the fetched data to answer user questions.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST be able to transform data into markdown format for presentation.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a response in natural language.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle errors gracefully when the Polymarket API is unavailable or returns an error.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST inform the user when it is unable to answer a question.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Query**: The natural language question asked by the user.
- **Polymarket Data**: Data fetched from the Polymarket API (e.g., markets, trades, order books).
- **Analysis Result**: The result of the analysis performed on the Polymarket data.
- **Response**: The natural language response provided to the user, potentially including markdown formatted data.
