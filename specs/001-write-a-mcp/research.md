# Research: Polymarket MCP Server

## Natural Language Processing with a Large Language Model (LLM)

**Decision**: We will use a large language model (LLM) to process natural language queries from the user. This will allow us to build a flexible and powerful interface for data analysis.

**Rationale**: The feature description explicitly asks for a "natural language" interface. Using an LLM is the most effective way to achieve this. It will allow us to handle a wide range of user queries without having to define a rigid command structure.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Keyword-based search**: This would be simpler to implement, but it would be much less flexible and powerful than using an LLM. Users would have to learn a specific syntax for asking questions.
- **Custom NLP model**: Building a custom NLP model would be a significant undertaking and is not necessary for this project. A pre-trained LLM will be sufficient.

**LLM Selection**:

**Decision**: We will start with the Gemini API, as this is a Gemini-based agent.

**Rationale**: The Gemini API is a powerful and easy-to-use LLM that is well-suited for this type of application. It provides a good balance of performance, features, and cost.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: A powerful and popular LLM, but the Gemini API is a more natural fit for this project.
- **Anthropic Claude 3**: Another excellent LLM, but again, the Gemini API is the preferred choice for this project.

## MCP Server Tool Design

**Decision**: We will create a set of tools for the MCP server that correspond to the different types of analysis that users will want to perform. These tools will be designed to be flexible and extensible.

**Rationale**: A tool-based approach is a good way to structure the MCP server. It will allow us to add new functionality easily and to reuse code between different tools.

**Tool Design Patterns**:
- **Search**: A general-purpose search tool that can be used to find markets based on a variety of criteria (e.g., date range, tags, category, status, keywords).
- **Analysis**: A set of tools for performing different types of analysis on market data (e.g., calculating volume, finding top markets, etc.).
- **Transformation**: A set of tools for transforming data into different formats (e.g., markdown tables).
