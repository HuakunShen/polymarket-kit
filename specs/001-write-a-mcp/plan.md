# Implementation Plan: Polymarket MCP Server

**Branch**: `001-write-a-mcp` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-write-a-mcp/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The primary requirement is to build an MCP server that provides a natural language interface for analyzing Polymarket data. The server will leverage the existing REST API to fetch data and use a large language model to understand and respond to user queries. The server will expose tools for searching and analyzing market data.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (latest, from `package.json`)
**Primary Dependencies**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`, `elysia`
**Storage**: N/A (data is fetched from the Polymarket API)
**Testing**: `bun:test`
**Target Platform**: Node.js/Bun
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the expected response times for user queries?]
**Constraints**: Must use the existing Polymarket REST API.
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many concurrent users should the server support?]
**User Implementation Details**: learn from the weather mcp server, and implement a polymarket MCP, features like searching for events with date range, tag, category, whether finished, keywords would be helpful.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (MCP Server)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes, the MCP server will be a new feature.
- Libraries listed: `polymarket-mcp-server`
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 1

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research best practices for integrating a large language model (LLM) for natural language query processing.
   - Determine the best LLM to use (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini).
   - Research how to structure the tools for the MCP server to allow for flexible querying (date range, tags, etc.).

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research best practices for building a natural language interface for data analysis using an LLM."
   Task: "Evaluate and compare different LLMs for use in a natural language query processing application."
   Task: "Research design patterns for creating flexible and extensible tools for an MCP server."
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`
2. **Generate API contracts** → `/contracts/polymarket-mcp.yml`
3. **Generate contract tests**
4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`
5. **Update agent file incrementally** → `GEMINI.md`

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create tasks for setting up the MCP server.
- Create tasks for implementing each tool defined in the contract.
- Create tasks for writing tests for each tool.
- Create tasks for integrating the LLM for natural language processing.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Server setup -> Tool implementation -> LLM integration

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |
